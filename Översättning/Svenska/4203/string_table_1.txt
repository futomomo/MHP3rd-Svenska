2,Oh hi!<NEWLINE>Welcome to the Yukumo<NEWLINE>Village Hunters Guild!
2,Hey, like, you're the<NEWLINE>new Hunter in town,<NEWLINE>huh! I wanted to talk<NEWLINE>to you!
2,So, uh, I only came<NEWLINE>here recently, and<NEWLINE>still don't know much.<NEWLINE>As fellow newbies,<NEWLINE>let's be friends!
2,...Oh, right, yeah,<NEWLINE>business first. At<NEWLINE>this counter, you can<NEWLINE>arrange multiplayer<NEWLINE>quests.
2,Each quest has a set<NEWLINE>level, which you can<NEWLINE>see by the number of<NEWLINE>★s it has.
2,In general,<NEWLINE>1★～5★ are low rank,<NEWLINE>6★～8★ are high rank<NEWLINE>quests.
2,Lemme see... 1★ and<NEWLINE>2★ quests have weaker<NEWLINE>weak monsters, but you<NEWLINE>won't find very good<NEWLINE>materials, though.
2,In these first quests,<NEWLINE>anyone at all can join<NEWLINE>in, no matter how<NEWLINE>inexperienced. It's a<NEWLINE>good place for you and<NEWLINE>your friends to start.
2,But the real quests<NEWLINE>start at 3★! These<NEWLINE>have tougher monsters<NEWLINE>than the ones from the<NEWLINE>Village Elder!
2,3★ quests are HR1,<NEWLINE>or Hunter Rank 1.<NEWLINE>You'll need to work<NEWLINE>your way up to HR2 to<NEWLINE>take on 4★ quests,<NEWLINE>and HR3 for 5★<NEWLINE>quests.
2,To increase your HR,<NEWLINE>you're gonna need to<NEWLINE>complete some specific<NEWLINE>key quests.
2,Which quests, you ask?<NEWLINE>Um, hm. For 3★, there<NEWLINE>are four key quests:<NEWLINE>Royal...something...<NEWLINE>and, er, Barro..um,<NEWLINE>well...
2,Anyway, point is, once<NEWLINE>you get those four key<NEWLINE>quests outta the way,<NEWLINE>you'll unlock the<NEWLINE>special Urgent quest.
2,Once you clear the<NEWLINE>Urgent quest, Bam!<NEWLINE>Your HR goes up by 1!<NEWLINE>Then, wash, rinse, and<NEWLINE>repeat! Aim for the<NEWLINE>top and don't stop!
2,...Ahem. But you're<NEWLINE>just getting started,<NEWLINE>huh. At HR1, just take<NEWLINE>your time and explore.<NEWLINE>Good hunting, Newbie!
2,Okay! I can now accept<NEWLINE>all quests 1★ to 5★.<NEWLINE>So let's go!<NEWLINE>Newbie Power!
0,Hey, my #1 customer!<NEWLINE>What's up? You know,<NEWLINE>You can do multiplayer<NEWLINE>quests solo, too. So<NEWLINE>get out there and show<NEWLINE>'em who's boss!!
2,Ah, hello!<NEWLINE>Welcome to the Yukumo<NEWLINE>Hunters Guild!
2,Oh, hey, speak of the<NEWLINE>devil! Well, I guess<NEWLINE>you should go over and<NEWLINE>check out the Training<NEWLINE>School, then.
0,So, basically,<NEWLINE>come back after you<NEWLINE>talk with the Village<NEWLINE>Elder. Yeah!
2,Ah, hello!<NEWLINE>Welcome to the Yukump<NEWLINE>Hunters Guild!
2,Ah, so... you're<NEWLINE>another Hunter...<NEWLINE>right?
